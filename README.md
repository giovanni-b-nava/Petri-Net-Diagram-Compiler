# Petri Net Diagram Compiler
Simple language to generate a diagram from a text format Petri Net

This project has been developed as completion of the Language and Compilers course of Computer Engineering, University of Bergamo, Italy.

The purpose of the project is to create a simple language that allows users to generate a diagram of a given Petri net represented in a text format. We created instructions in a pseudo-natural language, very intuitive and simple. Furthermore, the program is able to perform syntactic and semantic checks so as to realize the diagram only if the entered code is completely correct.
The end result is the image of the network inserted. To achieve it we relied on a LaTeX engine that has presented itself as the most effective tool to achieve our goal.
